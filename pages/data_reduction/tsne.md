## What is TOPIC-NAME?

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (commonly known as t-SNE) is a dimension reduction technique that preserves relative distances between points in high-dimensional data.


## Recommended Path for Learning

* General overview, given by one of the creators of t-SNE:

* An [in-depth breakdown (with an example in Python!)](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-t-sne-with-python-example-5a3a293108d1)
This blog post is particularly useful for building an intuition about how t-SNE is related to other data reduction techniques (like principle component analysis), as well as how parameters effect the structure of your t-SNE output.
